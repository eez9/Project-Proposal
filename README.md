E-Commerce Application

Created by Elian Zamora & Christopher McCorkle

This Current Project is a E-Commerce App that will allow a user to log in and create a post for an item that's going to be for sale (listing). The listing should also be able to be deleted or updated if needed. The App will allow listing searches depending on what listings are available. If a listing that is searched is not available then a message will be displayed stating that there are no mactches for the search. Functionality of this app will allow users to create, edit, and remove listing as well as search for other listings that are available. Listings will placed into categories that the user can select and will be able to be searched through their specific categories. Users will be able to see their current listings through their account page and other user's accounts will display their listings if a user wishes to see their listings only.

For phase one’s deliverable, we decided to implement the website’s design and UI elements to grasp a better understanding on how to implement the backend portion of the website (Phase 2) by completing the front end portion of the website. This allows for us to grasp the UI workflow and user experience before the backend is actually implemented, thereby avoiding common mistakes where the UI elements and website look are designed in an unintuitive fashion as a result of designing the backend first. In this report, we’ll be going over our implementation of the frontend design as outlined in the Phase one deliverables report. Our team overcame these challenges by using effective communication and making sure that our goal was as simple as possible, whilst trying to effectively achieve our frontend design in a manner that makes sense to both us as developers and users who will interact with the site.

For phase two’s deliverable, we decided to implement the back end portion of the application. By doing this, It allows for us to connect all of the different pieces created, to make the application work as a whole and have a better user experience. for pahse we go over our implementation of the backend design as outlined in the Phase two section of the deliverables report. Our team overcame these challenges by using effective communication and making sure that our goal was met and understood to the best of our ability, while trying to effectively achieve our backend design in a manner that makes sense to both us as developers and users who will interact with the site.
