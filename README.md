E-Commerce Application

Created by Elian Zamora & Christopher McCorkle

This Current Project is a E-Commerce App that will allow a user to log in and create a post for an item that's going to be for sale (listing). The listing should also be able to be deleted or updated if needed. The App will allow listing searches depending on what listings are available. If a listing that is searched is not available then a message will be displayed stating that there are no mactches for the search. Functionality of this app will allow users to create, edit, and remove listing as well as search for other listings that are available. Listings will placed into categories that the user can select and will be able to be searched through their specific categories. Users will be able to see their current listings through their account page and other user's accounts will display their listings if a user wishes to see their listings only.
